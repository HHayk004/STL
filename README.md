Picsart Code Republic C++ Level 0 STL Containers

There are these STL Containers
1) Vector (bool vector too with specialization)
2) Stack
3) Queue
4) LinkedList (forward)
5) Pair
6) BST (Binary Search Tree)
7) Graph (weighted, directed)
8) HashMap (unordered_map)

If you want to use my STL containers (not recommended, because there may be some bugs) in your projects, you must to du this steps
1) Be sure, that you have downloaded git (if not, here link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xqVv2lTo40)
2) Clone my git repository in your project folder with this command: git clone https://github.com/HHayk004/STL_Containers.git
3) Add #include "./STL_Containers/STL_Container name/STL_container name.h" (exaple: #include "./STL_Containers/Vector/vector.h")
4) adding objects (write STL Container name with capital letter) (example: Vector vec; BST tree; and etc);
5) Compile file with -std=c++11 option (or newer)
6) Enjoy if you don't find some bugs :)
